                        <p>Hi! My name is Gerwin and im a student at Code Institute.
                            This page is created for my last project, involving python3 and django.
                            I decided to make a fitness site because it was suggested as an option.
                            Also the reason I picked it is because I have recently gotten into fitness
                            myself with the new covid rules and not being able to go out it
                            feels good to still feel productive and fit!
                        </p>
